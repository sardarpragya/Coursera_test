				Chicken
			</div>
			
			<p>
				Chicken is the most common type of poultry in the world. 
				Owing to the relative ease and low cost of raising them in 
				comparisonto animals such as cattle or hogs, chickens have become 
				prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures around the world, and their
				meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes. Chicken can be prepared
				in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and 
				boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of 
				the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food.

				Beef
			</div>
			
			<p>Beef is the meat of cattle (Bos taurus). It is categorized as red meat 
			  â€” a term used for the meat of mammals, which contains higher amounts of iron than chicken or fish.
			  Usually eaten as roasts, ribs, or steaks, beef is also commonly ground or minced. 
			  Patties of ground beef are often used in hamburgers. Processed beef products include 
			  corned beef, beef jerky, and sausages.Fresh, lean beef is rich in various vitamins 
			  and minerals, especially iron and zinc. Therefore, moderate intake of beef can be 
			  recommended as part of a healthy diet.
